            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Hiſtory of the Bleſſed man <hi>F. Ignatius <pb facs="tcp:16367:3"/>of Loyola;</hi> I
could not doubt, but that it would be gratefull to YOV, who haue deſerued
ſo well of his Children liuing in our afflicted Country. And therfore my
choyce was ſoone made of your Self, before all others, to direct this my
ſmall labour vnto: which indeed is ſo ſmall, that vnleſſe the matter
which it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth were eſteemed, it were not worth the offering to any.
Wherfore you muſt not thanke me, but your owne vertuous Diſpoſition, if
you take any content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therein.</p>
            <p>To which (if you will needes haue ſome other to partake with
you) that Worthie and Reuerend Man <hi>Father Peter Ribadeneyra,</hi> who is
the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, deſerueth beſt to be added, being in a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner from his
Childhood brought vp in the Religious Schoole of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Bleſſed
Father, &amp; continued ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, with great edification, aboue <hi>70.</hi> 
               <pb facs="tcp:16367:3"/>yeares: and among his many pious and profitable labours, was very
eminent for his writings, eſpecially in the Spaniſh Tongue, as is well
knowne to all of that nation, by his many deuout &amp; learned Treatiſes
which are extant. But aboue all other, by thoſe which appertayne to Hiſtory
among which our Nation was not forgotten; for he tranſlated &amp; aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
<hi>D. Saunders</hi> Bookes, <hi>Of our Engliſh Schiſme,</hi> beginning
with King <hi>Henry the VIII.</hi> who vpon the foule occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which the
world knoweth, was the firſt cauſe therof and proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſame
vnto the later dayes of Queene <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He alſo wrote with great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Liues of all the
Saints which are ſet downe in the Roman Calendar, and of diuers others. By
occaſion of which he publiſhed this briefe Narratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Bleſſed
Father Ignatius,</hi> which I <pb facs="tcp:16367:4"/>haue tranſlated; wherein, as in an,
A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment, he, in few wordes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth that which he had ſet down
more at large in a former Treatiſe, and withall inſerted many not able
miracles, which had byn wrought by this Holy Man, for the moſt part, after
the edition of his former booke. And yet he relateth not all: for God hath
ſince that time lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe continued to manifeſt the great ſanctity of
this Bleſſed Father by many more, in diuers partes of the Chriſtian
world. I will only make mention of one, which hath byn publiſhed in print,
and happened in the Prouince of <hi>Perù,</hi> and in the Citty of
<hi>Lima,</hi> of which I make choice, the rather, becauſe the occaſion
therof was taken by reading of thoſe, which are recited in this Relation.</p>
            <p>In the Conuent of <hi>S. Dominike</hi> in the forſayd Citty
there was a Religious man of that Order, named <hi>Father Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarus <pb facs="tcp:16367:4"/>de Molina,</hi> a man of good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and only hindred from great
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiments by long &amp; continuall ſicknes: for he had byn moleſted with
a dead pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy for the ſpace of ten yeares; eight of which he had likewiſe
ſo terrible a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uulſion, as the Phiſitians call it, that he could not
mooue his body, nor goe one ſteppe, nor lift his handes to his head, nor
almoſt ſpeake any word that could be vnderſtood. The Phiſitians &amp;
Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons had giuen him ouer, accounting his diſeaſe incurable. Wherefore
the good Father conforming his wil to that of God, ſpent most of his tyme in
praying &amp; reading ſpiritual bookes, for which he aceded ſome helpe, not
being able to turne ouer the leaues himſelf.</p>
            <p>Hauing ended one of thoſe deuout bookes, he deſired <hi>F.
Iames de Ojeda,</hi> a Religious ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſame Order, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him
another, which he willingly <pb facs="tcp:16367:5"/>vndertooke, &amp; made choyce of this
our History, giuing great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The other accepted it very
willingly, &amp; hauing read the Miracles co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyned therein, he conceiued ſo
great deuotion to <hi>B. F. Ignatius,</hi> &amp; had ſuch firme co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
in his interceſsion, that he made a vow to fast his Vigil, or Eue, ſo long
as he liued, &amp; to make a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>memoration of him twice euery day, beſides
other deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which he would always vſe towards him, togeather with a
particuler affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; good will to his Order, if it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God to
reſtore his health &amp; ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth by the prayers of this holy man. This vow
cauſed him extraordinary co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, &amp; ſo he renewed it dayly, vntil it
plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God to renew &amp; reſtore him his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer health and ſtrength,
which he did within leſſe then a fortnight, after the first making thereof,
in manner fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:16367:5"/>
            <p>Vpon the <hi>8.</hi> day of Noue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, which is the Octaue of
All-Saints, in the yeare of our Lord <hi>1607.</hi> betweene <hi>4.</hi> &amp;
<hi>5.</hi> of the clock in the afternoone, <hi>Father Aluarus</hi> ſitting
in his chayre, as he was allwayes wont when he was out of his bed, felt within
himſelf an inward impulſion or motion, and as it were a voyce, which
incouraged him &amp; ſayd: Riſe vp, &amp; walke; &amp; this was with ſo
great delight and ſatisfaction, that he ſtood vp, and began to goe: and
finding himſelf ſtrong &amp; able, he went downe a payre of stayres, where
he met with many that came from an Act of Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, who did all wonderfully
admyre to ſee him goe in that manner. To whome he related his vow, &amp; how
it had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God to cure him thus perfectly by the interceſsion of
<hi>B. Father Ignatius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which narration of his, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered yet more plainly the
greatneſſe <pb facs="tcp:16367:6"/>of the Miracle: for wheras before ſcarce any word
he ſayd could be vnderſtood, ſo that it was neceſſary to make him
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate the ſame thing often, &amp; to go ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neere vnto him; now there
was no ſuch difficulty at all, for he ſpake very clearly &amp;
diſtinctly. The Religious men of that houſe, ſeeing ſo euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a
Miracle, went preſently into the Church, and <hi>F. Aluarus</hi> with them,
who hauing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated himſelfe before the <hi>Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi>
the reſt ſung <hi>Te Deum laudamus,</hi> with Muſike and Organs: which
being done, they ſent word of all to the Colledge of the Society of
<hi>Ieſus,</hi> diuers Religious men of S. <hi>Dominiks</hi> Order going
thither to congratulate with them, affirming that this Miracle had as many
witneſſes, as there were Religious men in their houſe, &amp; that it was
ſo euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that the Diuel himſelf could not calumniate it: ſo that it
alone <pb facs="tcp:16367:6"/>were ſufficient to mooue any Gentile to belieue, that the
Catholike Romane fayth is the true Religion, and that B. Father
<hi>Ignatius</hi> is a Saint.</p>
            <p>The Phiſitians alſo did affirme with one conſent, that it
was a manifeſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, and <hi>Father Aluarus</hi> his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe was
ſo notorious, that a thouſand wittneſſes might eaſily haue byn found
to affirme the ſame. It was ſtrange to ſee, what wonderfull Ioy,
Deuotion, and Admiration this Miracle cauſed in all that Citty. God grant we
may diſpoſe our ſelues to find the like effects, which wee may the more
eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, if we help our ſelues with the Holy interceſsion of
<hi>Bleſſed Father Ignatius.</hi> From the reading of whoſe hiſtory, I
will not detayne you any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but earneſtly entreat you to be mindfull of
me in your deuout prayers, &amp; particulerly in thoſe which you make 
<pb facs="tcp:16367:7"/>to this Glorious Patriarch. Which requeſt I likewiſe make to
all others, who ſhall reape any benefit by this my ſmall labour. And ſo I
end, and reſt, This feaſt of All-Saintes <hi>1615.</hi>

and Don Ferdinandus with Don<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>a Iſabella of glorious memory gouerning the
Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Kingdome of Spayne. His Father was named Beltram Iagnez, Lord of
Ognez and Loyola, and head of that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and Ancient family. His Mother
was named Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria Sonez of Balda, daughter to the Lords of the Houſe and
Teritory of Balda, a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron equall to her husband both in birth and nobility.
Theſe two houſes of Loyola and Balda are of thoſe which are called Great,

Guipuzcoa.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our Ignatius from his child-hood diſcouered a quick,
ſharp, and great wit; and after ſome few yeares he was ſent to the
Catholike Kings Court, that he might there be brought vp amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g his Equalls. His
courage increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with his age, he gaue himſelfe earneſtly to all
man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of warlike exerciſe, that he might obtayne the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being
valiant, and of military honor and glory.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It happened that in the yeare 1521. the Frenchmen
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieging the Caſtle of Pampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona, Ignatius entred into it with the
Captaynes and ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that were appointed <pb n="4" facs="tcp:16367:11"/>for the
defence thereof. The ſiege being very ſtraite, and they who were within
ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no hope of ſuccour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to treat of a compoſition, and had
concluded it, if Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius had not oppoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, incouraging them to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the enemy vntill death. But the French men conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing their
battery of the Caſtle, while Ignatius defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it,<note place="margin">He is
woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the caſtle of Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelona.</note> he was wounded
with a bullet in his right legge, ſo that the bones thereof were not only
broken, but alſo ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in peeces: and beſides a ſtone being driuen
out of the wall with the force of the bullet, had alſo ſorely hurt his left
legge. Ignatius being thus ouerthrowne, the reſt were <pb n="5" facs="tcp:16367:11"/>diſcomfited, &amp; yiedled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the French, who ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
Ignatius to their Tents, and vnderſtanding who he was, cauſed him to be
very carefully looked vnto, and after ſent him home in a litter vpon mens
ſhoulders.</p>
            <p n="4">4. His ſicknes increaſed in ſuch ſort, that there was
little hope of his life: but our Lord releeued him in his greateſt danger,
ſending vnto him the moſt glorious Prince of the Apoſtles S. Peter,<note place="margin">S. Peter appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him, and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his health.</note> to
whom he had euer byn very deuout, vpon the Eue of his Feaſt: and he appeared
vnto him as one, who came to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour him, &amp; reſtore his health. With this
viſitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the holy Apoſtle our ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ldier began to <pb n="6" facs="tcp:16367:12"/>wax better, and to recouer his
health: but deſiring to become a Gallant, and to follow the neateſt and
fineſt faſhions, he cauſed a bone which remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſticking out
deformedly vnder his knee to be cut of, that ſo he might (as I haue heard him
ſay) draw on a ſtraite boot. Neyther would he be bound while it was a doing
eſteeming it a thing vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his noble mind. And though the paine were
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, &amp; very ſharp (becauſe they were to cut into the quick) yet he
kept his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and ſhewed ſuch cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, as cauſed admiration,
neuer changing colour, nor once ſighing or ſpeaking any word, which might
diſcouer <pb n="7" facs="tcp:16367:12"/>any weaknes, as he had done before in all the
reſt of his cure.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In the tyme of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery lying in his bed, and being
accuſtomed to read prophane books of Chiualry, he asked for ſome ſuch
vayne Treatiſe, to paſſe the tyme withall, which ſeemed long, and
tedious. They brought him two bookes, one of the Life of Chriſt, and the
other of the Liues of Saints,<note place="margin">He is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the liues of Saints.</note> there being none of thoſe others which he would
haue had in the houſe. Wherefore he be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gan to read in theſe at the
be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ginning, that he might paſſe away the tyme, but afterward he tooke great
delight and af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fection therin: and our Lord <pb n="8" facs="tcp:16367:13"/>wrought ſo
farre in the hart of Ignatius with that reading, that he was changed,
concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a deſire to imitate that which he read. So, that though he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
great repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny contentions and grieuous combats within himſelfe,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his long and inueterate cuſtome, and the ſubtilties &amp;
tentations of Sathan were of great force to detayne him in the world; yet
notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Grace preuayled againſt corruption of nature, and the
Comfort of heauen againſt the tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny of his former euill life, and the
fauour of God who had choſen him for great matters, againſt all the crafts,
and deceipts of the enemy. Wherefore one night riſing <pb n="9" facs="tcp:16367:13"/>out
of his bed (as he was often wont) to pray, &amp; knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe before a
picture of our B. Lady, with humble and feruent confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
himſelfe by the meanes of this glorious Mother, to her bountifull and
mercifull Sonne, for his faythfull ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier and ſeruant, promiſing him
to follow his Enſigne and to forſake the world.</p>

            <head>CHAP. II.</head>
            <p>AT the very tyme, that he made this prayer, there was a very great
noyſe heard in all the houſe, and the <pb n="10" facs="tcp:16367:14"/>chamber where he
was did ſhake, and a glaſſe window in it was broken. In this his change
of life he greatly fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the weakenes of his fleſh, but the moſt ſacred
Virgin, and moſt ſoueraigne Queene of the Angells (to whom he moſt
deuoutly commended himſelfe) appeared vnto him one night while he was
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake,<note place="margin">Our B. Lady appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him with our Sauiour in

gaue him ſuch great grace, and changed him in that manner, cleanſing his
ſoule from all filthy, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt delight, that from that inſtant
to the end of his life, he remayned pure and chaſt, without any ſpot, in
great <pb n="11" facs="tcp:16367:14"/>integrity, and freedome.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He ſought to imbrace that ſtate and manner of life, in
which he might afflict his body with more rigour &amp; pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and find God
more perfectly. To this end he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to forſake his houſe, kindred,
and acquaintance; which he did, his elder brother Martin Garcia of Loyola not
being able to diſſwade him to the contrary: and by occaſion of viſiting
the Duke of Naj<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ara, he went to our B. Ladyes of Montſerat attended by two
men,<note place="margin">He go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to Montſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, and diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth himſelf
euery night.</note> whom he ſent back by the way, giuing them part of that
which he had.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From the day that he departed from home, he vſed euery
night to make a ſharp <pb n="12" facs="tcp:16367:15"/>diſcipline, which he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
al his iourney: and being inflamed in the loue of God, and burning with zeale
of his honour, he now referred all that he did, &amp; purpoſed to do, TO GODS
GREATER GLORY for this was alway, as it were the Poeſy of Ignatius, and the
ſoul, and life of all his workes. Likewiſe in this iourney he made a vow of
chaſtity, and offered to Chriſt our Lord the purity of his ſoule and
body,<note place="margin">He ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a vow of chaſtity.</note> with ſingular
deuotion, and a feruent deſyre to obtayn it, as he did, in that entyre &amp;
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete manner, which we haue already mentioned.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In a Village not far from Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tſerat he bought him a
gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or habit, which he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed <pb n="13" facs="tcp:16367:15"/>to weare in the
Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage which he intended to Hieruſalem: and this was a coate of
ſackcloth, or courſe canuaſe, down to the foot, and a cord for his
girdle, a payr of country buskyns, a little botle, and a Pilgrims ſtaffe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Comming to that Holy place of our B. Lady at Montſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,
the firſt thing he did was to ſeeke (as a ſick man who deſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reth
health) the beſt Phiſitian, and Confeſſarius which he could find, to
diſcouer his wounds vnto him. He found a Holy roligious man of the French
nation called Fr. Iohn Clanon, a great ſeruant of God,<note place="margin">He
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a generall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> known, &amp; reuerenced for ſuch.
With this good Father, Ignatius made a generall Confeſſion of 
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:16367:16"/>all his life for the ſpace of three dayes, with great
diligence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, and feeling of his ſins: And this religious man was
the firſt to whom he opened his purpoſes, and intents, as to his
ſpirituall Father, and Maiſter. He gaue his horſe to the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,
and cauſed his ſword, and dagger with which he had ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the world
before to be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vp at our B. Ladies Altar, ſeeking other new &amp; more
reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plendent weapons to ſerue our Lord withall.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To this end vpon the Eue of that ioyfull, and moſt
glorious day, the 25. of March, in which the eternal Word clad himſelf with
our fleſh in the womb of his moſt pure Mother the yeare 1522. very
ſecretly in <pb n="15" facs="tcp:16367:16"/>the night he went to a poore Pilgrim,
altogether deſtitute of apparell, which was there, and putting of all his
cloathes (vnto his ſhirt) he gaue him them, &amp; cloathed himſelf with
that his deſired ſackcloth which he had bought, and with much deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
placed himſelfe before the Altar of the B. Virgin, where he remayned all that
night, partly ſtanding, and partly kneeling, to watch like a new knight of
Chriſt thoſe his new and in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance poore,<note place="margin">He
wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of new ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</note> &amp;
weake wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, but indeede very rich, and ſtrong, commending him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
earneſtly to the protection of the moſt Sacred Virgin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayling his
ſinnes moſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, and purpoſing to amend them with her fauour.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:16367:17"/>
            <p n="7">7. In the morning before it was day, that he might not be
knowne, he departed in great haſt towards a towne called Manreſa, which
ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth at the foote of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn three leagues from Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerat, and
ſomewhat out of the high way to Barcelona. In this manner Ignatius went
ioyfull being clad with that poore, and courſe ſackcloth, girded with a
cord, carrying his pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims ſtaff in his hand, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hat, and wearing
a ſhoo but vpon one foot only, which ſeemed neceſſary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that
leg was yet weake, and not thoroughly recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, in ſo much that it
ſwelled a new euery night. But this his ioy was preſently diminiſhed 
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:16367:17"/>by the comming of one to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of him, whether it were
true, that he had giuen his gich apparell to a poore ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whom the officers had
apprehended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuſpecting, leaſt he had ſtoln them. By this means he
was enforced to tel the truth, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer him that was innocent, and he ſhed
many teares, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himſelf to great a ſinner, that he could not ſo
much as help his neighbour without doing him harm, and putting him to ſhame.
And though they asked him his Name, who he was, and alſo from whence he came,
yet he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them to none of theſe queſtions, thinking that there was
no cauſe why he ſhould, and deſyring to be vnknown, <pb n="18" facs="tcp:16367:18"/>and deſpiſed in the eyes of the world.</p>
            <p n="8">8. In Manreſa he went directly to the hoſpitall of S.
Lucie,<note place="margin">What pennan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce he did at Manreſa</note> that he
might lyue on almes among the poore. He began to afflict, and waſt his body
with a very ſharp, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous life, &amp; to mortify al the delights &amp;
vayne cares which he had before. And becauſe he had bin curious in the world
in trymming his hayre, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorning his perſon, now he went bareheaded night
and day, neuer vſing combe, or any thing els therto: and with the ſame
contempt of himſelf he ſuffered his nayles, &amp; beard to grow out of

weaken him ſo much, as the inward ſcruples, &amp; anxietyes which tormented

Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty, our Lord vouchſafed to comfort his ſeruant, and to illuſtrate

went to a Spaniards houſe, an old acquaintance of his, who by many intreaties
had inuited him thither. After this he ſpake to Andrew Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti, who at that

ſhip in which the new gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour himſelfe went.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The 14. day of Iuly of the ſame yeare 1523. he went

taken a Purgation by reaſon a of great ague, which at that very tyme had
aſſayled him: and yet Phiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans tould him, that if he tooke ſhip that

an other ſuperiour Phiſitian made no account of that which they ſayd, and
indeed his going to ſea was the cauſe of his perfect recouery.</p>
            <p n="8">8. In this ſhip wherin he went there were great ſins &amp;

            <p>THE tyme in which our Pilgrim returned from Hieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into Italy
was very troubleſe me with ſnow, and froſt, being in the hart of winter.
His garment was of courſe canuas, and his doublet which giuen him of almes,
was all cut, and open in the back: his cloake was ſhort, and thrid bare, and
of bad cloth: he had no ſtockings at all, but only ſhoes vpon his feet He
found in Cyprus three ſhips ready <pb n="49" facs="tcp:16367:33"/>to depart:<note place="margin">He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth into Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and the little ſhip in which he

belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the Turke, another which was very ſtrong, and wel appointed was
of Venice: and the third was a little old bark, almoſt rotten and
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed. In this third, our Ignatius ſhipped himſelf, for the Captayne
of the Venetian ſhip vnderſtanding that he was poore, and had not where
withall to pay him, would not admit him: ſaying, that if he were as Holy, as
ſome gaue out, he might walk vpon the water, for he ſhould not be drowned.
All theſe three ſhips put themſelues to ſayle the ſame day and houre
with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous wynd; but in the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning there came vpon them a
tempeſtuous ſtorme, with <pb n="50" facs="tcp:16367:34"/>which the Turkiſh ſhip was
caſt away with all her people: that of Venice ran herſelf vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ground neere
to the Iſle of Cyprus, and was caſt away, though the men in her were
ſaued: and only the little bark, in which the ſeruant of God went, being
old, and worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaten, arriued ſafe at Venice, in the middeſt of Ianuary the
yeare 1524.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In Venice he reſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a few dayes, and
after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards tooke his iourney for Spayn, hauing only 7. or 8. ſhillings,
which were giuen him of almes, and a peece of cloth to couer, and keep warm his
ſtomack, which he felt to be much weakened, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, by the force of
the cold <pb n="51" facs="tcp:16367:34"/>and his nakednes. But going forward in his

there came certaine poore people to aske of him almes, and he gaue them all the
money he had, and going out of the Church, went from dore to dore asking a
peece of bread to eat according to his cuſtome.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From thence he tooke his way for Genua, and paſſed by
the armyes, and camps of the Spaniſh, and French ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers who at that

the firſt principles of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of a vertuous, and deuout Maiſter called
Hierome Arde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balus, who taught Schoole in Barcelona, the Lady Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth

was neceſſary for his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenance; ſo great was the ſpirit &amp;

though the Diuell tooke vpon him diuers formes, and vſed new craſis &amp;

            <p n="2">2. He felt himſelf in Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celona ſomwhat caſed of the
payne of his ſtomack, and he preſently returned to the great rigour of his
accuſtomed pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances which by reaſon of his <pb n="55" facs="tcp:16367:36"/>want of
health, and the labour of ſo long a iourney, he had ſomewhat remitted.
Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he made certaine holes in the ſoles of his ſhoes, and tore them
by litle and litle, ſo that in the beginning of winter he went barefoote vpon
the ground, though his feet were couered with the vpper lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: &amp; this
to auoid oftenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he alſo did in his other Pennances.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In Barcelona there befell him two notable thinges in which
he ſhewed his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and charity:<note place="margin">He is miſuſed for
the defence of Gods honour.</note> The one was, that hauing notice of certayne
light young men, who diſquieted the Nunnery called <hi>Of the Angells,</hi>
wherein there liued Religious women <pb n="56" facs="tcp:16367:37"/>of S. Dominicks order,
&amp; was ſcituated at that tyme without the walls of the citty: he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
to perſwade the Nunns to auoid thoſe conuerſations &amp; occaſions, and
to giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to all recollection, and denotion. By which exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
thoſe good fellowes, not finding their former inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynment in that
Monaſtery, were much troubled, and threatned the Bleſſed Father. And
finally diuers tymes they refrayned not from blowes, &amp; once they
miſuſed him very much, ſo that he had neceſſity to be cured: but for
all this he gaue not ouer his enterprize, reioycing greatly to ſuffer for the
loue of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The ſecond thing was, <pb n="57" facs="tcp:16367:37"/>that comming
one day from the foreſaid monaſtery <hi>Of the Angells,</hi> it happened
that a man had hanged himſelfe v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon one of the beames in his chamber,<note place="margin">Hereſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth life to one that had hanged himſelfe that he
might be ſory for his ſinnes.</note> into which the good Father ſpeedily
entred, and cut downe the rope; and though all held the man for dead, yet did
he fall to his prayers, and cryed vnto him, ſo that the man recouered his
ſenſes, and gaue ſignes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and ſorrow for his ſins, and
a little after gaue vp the ghoſt. In which accident the circumſtances that
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red were ſuch, that it was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous in the whole Citty, through
which it was ſoone diuulged. He ſtayed in Barce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona two yeares ſtudying 
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:16367:38"/>Grammer, vntill that by the counſail of ſome learned
men in the yeare 1526. he went to the Vniuerſity of Alcala, that he might
paſſe to other high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſciences.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In Alcala he lyed in the Hoſpitall of Lewis of Antezana,
which was there founded: &amp; he began to ſtudy Logick, and Philoſophy:
and withall heard the Maiſter of Sentences, by the counſell of ſome, who
with a deſire to haue him end quickly, knew not how to direct him. But he
became now ſo inflamed with the loue of God, &amp; with an inſatiable
thirſt to helpe, and remedy the ſoules, and bodies of his neyghbours, that
he contented not himſelfe <pb n="59" facs="tcp:16367:38"/>with the ordinary labour of his
ſtudies, and of asking almes from dore to dore,<note place="margin">His
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour in Alcala</note> to ſuſtayne himſelfe, but that withall he
taught children, and ignorant people the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme, or Chriſtian

gathered almes with which he proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded victualls for ſuch poore, as
ſuffered moſt neceſſity.</p>
            <p n="6">6. This cauſed great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration in that Vniuerſity, and
it was more increaſed by ſeing our Bleſſed Father clad with one only
coate of courſe cloth, going barefoot, and in his company other three in the
ſame attyre, who follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, as moued by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; <pb n="60" facs="tcp:16367:39"/>and beſides another young man of France adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himſelfe vnto
them: So that they were called (as it were in mockery) thoſe of the Blancket,
or courſe cloth. This admiration (cauſed by the nouelty) gaue occaſion,
that he and thoſe in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany were diuerſly ſpoken of in the towne,
euery one inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting that which he did ſee, or heare, according to his
owne affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And although great diligence, and much inquiry was made, &amp;
diuers and exquiſite informations taken by the Licenciate Iohn Figueroa (who
afterward dyed Preſident of Caſtilla, &amp; at that tyme was Vicar
Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of Alcala to the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <pb n="61" facs="tcp:16367:39"/>of Toledo) of his
life, and doctrine: yet there was neuer found in word or deed, any vice in his
life, or errour in his doctrine, as the ſame Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car teſtified. Albeit for
the greater tryall of the Bleſſed Father,<note place="margin">He is

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to priſon without any fault.</note> and that the truth might be
more knowne, they afterward apprehended him vpon a falſe ſuſpition, and
kept him in priſon 42. dayes with great ioy. of his ſpirit, to ſee
himſelfe ſuffer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fault for Chriſt, which was the thing that he
deſired much.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Wherfore though ſome perſons of great Authority who
were much deuoted to him, offered him their fauour ſaying, that they would
cauſe <pb n="62" facs="tcp:16367:40"/>him to be ſet at liberty, if he would; yet he
neuer gaue his conſent, nor would take any Proctor, or Aduocate, nor any
other to plead for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, thinking defence not to be neceſſary,
where there was no fault. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if he had done amiſſe in any
thing, he deſired to be corrected by the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Superiors, to
whom all his life he ſhewed himſelfe a child of obedience. After 42 dayes
the matter being tryed, and the Proceſſe being conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they reſtored
him, and his company to their former freedome, the Vicar afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid declaring
by his ſentence that they were found altogea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther innocent, and without 
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:16367:40"/>fault in any thing which was obiected againſt them.</p>
            <p n="8">8. There happened one thing to the bleſſed Father here in

the matter to a Prieſt named Iohn of Lucena, who imployed himſelfe in
workes of charity, deſiring him to procure ſome almes, to buy him cloathes.
They two went one day asking this almes, &amp; they came to a ſtreet where
many of good ſort ſtood loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on thoſe who were play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at bal, nigh
to the houſe of <pb n="64" facs="tcp:16367:41"/>a principall Knight, whom I wil not name
for iuſt reſpects. This Knight vnderſtanding that they asked almes for
that effect, in a great rage, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the ſaid Iohn of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cena, asked
him, Why one of his quality would procure that almes? And he added, <hi>Let me
be burnt, if this fellow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue not to be burned.</hi> Which words were
cauſe of great ſcandall to thoſe, who after came to know it, and were
acquainted with the Fathers ſanctity. But the ſame day, there came newes,
that King Philip the ſecond was borne, in joy whereof there were great
feaſts, and triumphs made in Alcala, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Spaine. Vpon which 
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:16367:41"/>occaſion the foreſaid Knight went vp to a Turret in his
houſe, where then was a great quantity of gun-powder pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, to make
artificiall fyers, and by chance a ſparke fell into the powder; which
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently blew vp the Tower, the Knight being therwith killed and burnt.</p>
            <p n="9">9. When the bleſſed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was told of this, ſheding
many teares of pitty, and compaſſion, he ſayd: He fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told it himſelfe
this morning, when I paſſed by his houſe, for I wiſhed him no ſuch

guided him, arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſafe at Paris, without paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any danger in the
begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of February 1528.</p>
            <p n="3">3. At Paris before he went forward in other higher ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes,
he perfected himſelfe in the Latin tongue, ſtudying Humanity almoſt two
yeares. After this he began his courſe of Philoſophy,<note place="margin">His
ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours &amp; perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at Paris.</note> and ended it with
great commendation, taking the degree of Maiſter of Arts, by his Maiſters
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, and that by this degre he might (before men) haue ſome
teſtimony of his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the better to help others. Hauing ended his
courſe of Philoſophy, he ſtudyed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity, <pb n="73" facs="tcp:16367:45"/>our Lord
doing him great mercy, and fauours: and beſydes the labour which he tooke in
ſtudying, he endured other great, &amp; extraordinary incommodityes For in
the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning he liued in the Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall of S. Iames, asking from dore to
dore that which he was euery day to eat, and he was alſo inforced the 3.
firſt yeares to go diuers tymes to Flaunders, and once into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland to
gather ſome almes of the Spaniſh merchants who reſided there) with which
he might poorely ſuſtayne his life. He gaue himſelfe likewiſe to very
auſtere pennances, &amp; to ſuch a rigorous life, that it alone was
ſufficient to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaue him of his health, as in <pb n="74" facs="tcp:16367:46"/>effect it
did, in ſuch ſort, that he was conſtrayned (not wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout euident perill
of his life) to interrupt the courſe of his ſtudies.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Now what ſhall I ſay of his other imployments in
helping, inflaming, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting his neighbours to all vertue? What of the
moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous perſecutions which he endured for this cauſe, which were
many, and very conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall? For certaine young ſchollers, being noble and of
excellent witts, hauing forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken al that they had, to follow the
counſailes of Chriſt our Lord, and moued with the wordes and example of
this Bleſſed Father, made a great change in their life, and gaue 
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:16367:46"/>all their wealth to the poore, begging themſelues from
dore to dore, and lyuing as poore people in the hoſpitall. This cauſed a
great ſtyrre in the Vniuerſity, and their kindred &amp; friends (who were
not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſuch courſes) concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued great hatred againſt him,
whome they knew to be the author of that new life, which they accounted folly.
And ſo they began to perſecute, and calumniate him, raiſing many falſe
teſtimonies againſt him, as the world is wont to do, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Gods
ſeruants.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Neither did the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end in words alone: for in the
Colledge of S. Barbara<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where at that time, he ſtudyed Philoſophy,
they would haue <pb n="76" facs="tcp:16367:47"/>corrected him publickly, with a ſeuere,
&amp; publick kind of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment which vſed to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted vpon ſuch as
were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, and of a turbulent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour: and this, becauſe he exhorted
his ſchole-fellowes to the deuout frequentation of the Holy Sacraments, and
to giue themſelues vpon feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall dayes, more then at other tymes, to
prayer; and becauſe by this his counſail, a certaine Spaniſh ſchollar,
named Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore, had left the Colledge, &amp; the world to follow Chriſt naked
vpon the Croſſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And although the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knew before, what was intended,
and deuiſed againſt him, and after that the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge gates were ſhut,
and the <pb n="77" facs="tcp:16367:47"/>bell rung,<note place="margin">His for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude &amp;

their rods in their hands to correct him, and all the ſchollars gathered
toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to behould this ſpectacle, he remayned ſo vndaunted, that he was
neither troubled, nor ſhewed any weakenes: yea, leaſt the glory of Chriſt
ſhould be diminiſhed, &amp; Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue diſhonoured, and accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an ignomy

of the Colledge with ſuch a maieſty, and freedome (offering himſelfe on

&amp; on the other declaring <pb n="78" facs="tcp:16367:48"/>the harme, which thoſe who
were as yet but beginners, &amp; tender in vertue, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue, if he

there befor all thoſe who were gathered together asked par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of him, as of
a Saynt, who made no account of his owne ignominy, but only of the honour of
God, and the good of his neighbours.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Thus this chaſtiſement was omitted, and Vertue
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned with more reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the Holy Father came to be more known &amp;
the Rector (who was named Doctor Iames Gouea, of Portugall, a Jearned and pious

            <p n="8">8. Out of all that which men did againſt the Bleſſed
Father, God drew profit for the Father himſelf who endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, &amp; for

As it happened here in Paris, where his Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries not contenting
themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues with the calumniations, &amp; falſe ſuſpitions which they
had raiſed againſt the Bleſſed Father, they denounced him alſo to the

our Lord hauing called him to this ſo great an enterpriſe; he was attentiue
to nothing more then to gayne ſome yong men of good ability, and laudable
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſation, who might haue the ſame intention: and ſo he gained Peter

Codury of the Delphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat, and Paſchatius Broüet of the Prouince of
Picardy; ſo that they were in all ten. And though, they were of ſo

thoſe two Kingdomes were at ſuch ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible warres, notwithſtanding they
were all of one and the ſame hart, and will.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All theſe were Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Art, and ſtudied
Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <pb n="84" facs="tcp:16367:51"/>and the day of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of our
Bleſſed Lady at a Church not farre from Paris called <hi>Mons
Martyrum,</hi> after they had confeſſed, and receiued the body of Chriſt

themſelues at the Popes feet, the Vicegerent of Chriſt our Lord, that his

            <p n="3">3. This being agreed vpon among themſelues, Bleſſed
Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius gaue order to the reſt to take their iourney towards Venice, when
their ſtudyes were ended, where he would expect them, after that he had byn
firſt in Spaine, and diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched there certaine buſineſſe for ſome
of them, and other important affaires for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God, which cauſed
him to goe thither. With this reſolution he departed from Paris, and came to
his owne Countrey, where though his Brother were Lord of the Place, yet he
would by no meanes lodge in his houſe, <pb n="86" facs="tcp:16367:52"/>nor take that,
which he needed of him,<note place="margin">What he did in his owne
Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try</note> but liued in the hoſpitall, asking his poore Victualls from
dore to dore. There he taught the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme, of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Doctrine, and
preached with ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of people which came from many villages, that
he was inforced to preach in the fields, becauſe the multitude could not be
contayned in the Churches, and many that they might heare, and ſee him the
better, climbed vp into trees: and though the Father was very weake, and
ſicke of an ague, yet he preached thrice euery weeke; and all the words which

who had byn tormented by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell foure yeares. And our Lord wrought other
things by his meanes, which were held for miraculous; by reaſon wherof, and
for his holy life, all the people reſpected him ſo much, that they did
ſtriue to touch his garments, eſteming him as a Saint, and a great Seruant
of God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. From hence alone, &amp; without money, asking almes by the

Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, to diſpatch the buſines which was commended vnto him. Afterward he
took ſhip, neere to Valentia, for Italy, and with great labour,

But the Diuell eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming him now his open ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and foreſeeing the warre

            <p n="5">5. But our Lord Ieſus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing now taken Ignatius vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his

Guidichion in ſuch ſort, that he was heard to vtter theſe words: <hi>I

inwardly in my hart ſuch extraordinary motions, that the diuine Will carryeth
me to that, which I am not inclined to by reaſon; and imbrace that with my
affection, which by the force of humane reaſons I vtterly diſliked.</hi>
And thus this very Cardinall commended the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of the Society very

            <p n="6">6. But returning to our bleſſed Father Ignatius, when the

to take other foure dayes to commend that affayre to our Lord anew, and to
beſeech him to diſcouer vnto them his holy will. But they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in

            <p>PRESENTLY after he was made Generall, the firſt thing that he did,
was to riſe very early the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and to awake all the houſe;
iudging it to be his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to watch prepetually ouer all, and to procure,
that all his ſubiects ſhould watch &amp; euery one attend carefully to
their imployment. And to humble, and debaſe himſelfe ſo much the more, by
how much the degree in which God had pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <pb n="108" facs="tcp:16367:63"/>him was high

that he ſeemed a Nouice, who did it only for his owne grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter profit, and
mortification.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This being ended he began to catechize, or teach the
Chriſtian Doctrine in our Church, which he continued for the ſpace of
ſix, and forty dayes, explicating daily the commandements, articles, &amp;
other things appertayning to the principles of our holy faith. All which he
declared in Italian, with improper, and vnpoliſhed words, but vttered with
ſuch ſpirit, and <pb n="109" facs="tcp:16367:63"/>force, that they moued the hearers to
compunction; in ſuch ſort, that they were ſo pierced with ſorrow, that
preſently vpon hearing him they went to confeſſion, and could ſcarce

bewayled their ſinnes. Of which I my ſelfe am witnes, being at that tyme

            <p n="3">3. Beſides all this, the holy Father attended to plant,

in the world, giuing them inſtructions, by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation wherof they might
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come worthy workemen of Ieſus Chriſt; who with the edification, which by

&amp; increaſed their deuotion in ſuch ſort, that many deſired:
Colledges of the Society, to the end they might receiue the more profit by
their doctrine, and holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. And 20 this the holy Father did
carefully coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, ſending thoſe of the Society to the places, which
ſeemed moſt neceſſary, and conuenient for the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion 
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:16367:65"/>of ſuch Colledges, and houſes, as were required: and
that this plant, which our Lord of his goodnes would haue to increaſe ſo

            <p n="6">6. And becauſe the Diuell bare great hatred, and enuy to the
B. Father, and his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and in all parts moued great contradictions, and
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions againſt it; he as a valiant Captaine encountred the common
enemy, making as fierce reſiſtance againſt him, and clearing the truth,
not permitting that ſuch lyes, as the Diuell by his miniſters ſpread
abroad ſhould preuaile againſt it. Notwithſtanding the Father was not
content <pb n="114" facs="tcp:16367:66"/>with theſe ſo many, &amp; ſo great
imployme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which had beene able to weary a Gyant: but with an enflamed
deſire, and charity to helpe his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours (as if he had nothing els to do)
he laboured to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit them abroad, and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to extirpate certayne vices
out of the Citty of Rome, &amp; to inſtitute therin many workes much to Gods
glory, and the ſpirituall benefit of ſoules.</p>
            <p n="7">7. As for example: that the Phiſitians ſhould not cure the
bodyes of the ſick, before their ſoules were cured with the holy
ſacrament of Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,<note place="margin">The pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes which he
did in Rome.</note> according to the Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall of Innocentius the third. That
there ſhould be a houſe erected in Rome for the <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumeni;</hi> 
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:16367:66"/>in which the Iewes, and Infidells, who deſired
baptiſme, and are brought to the knowledg of the Truth, might be receyued and
main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned. To him likewiſe is the worke, commonly knowne by the appellation
of <hi>Our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Grace,</hi> to be attributed, which was begunne in the
monaſtery of S. Marcha, wher there was a Confraternity, or brotherhood
inſtituted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect, and retyre all ſuch maryed, or vnmaryed wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as
remained in euill eſtate, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they were reconciled to their husbands, or
had ſome other condition wherin they might liue without our Lords
offence.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And the charity of the <pb n="116" facs="tcp:16367:67"/>Bleſſed
Father was ſo great, that when theſe poore women forſooke their euill
life, he himſelfe would accompany them through the Citty, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
his yeares, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or office of Generall. And whereas ſome tould him,
that he loſt his tyme, becauſe theſe women through their euill cuſtome,
did eaſely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to their former vices, the holy man anſwered with
maruelous repoſe: <hi>I account not this labour loſt, yea I aſſure you,
that if with the labours &amp; cares of my whole life, I could procure any one
of theſe to paſſe only one night without ſinning, I would eſteeme
them well beſtowed, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Maieſty of my Creator, and Lord,
might not be offended in <pb n="117" facs="tcp:16367:67"/>that ſhort ſpace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. He laboured no leſſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue the neceſſity,
&amp; ſolitude of Orphanes. And ſo the two houſes which are in Rome, for
ſuch children of both ſexes were by his meanes erected. Likewiſe with no
leſſe, yea with more care, he procured the foundation of the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
of S. Catherine in Rome, called <hi>de Funarijs,</hi> in which Virgins, who
eyther by the negligence or defect of vertue in their mothers, or by reaſon
of their pouerty are in danger, doe retire themſelues, as to a ſanctuary.
For his charity was ſo great, that he alway treated of ſuch things, as
might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit his neighbours, and further their ſaluation. And that this 
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:16367:68"/>charity of the Bleſſed Father, togeather with his
fortitude, and conſtancy, in the workes which he vndertook for Gods greater
ſeruice, might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appeare, our Lord permited terrible
perſecutions, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts to be raiſed againſt him, for theſe his
good, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable labours: which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding finally did breake
their furious waues vpon the rocke of truth, and the workes remained more firme
with theſe contradictions; and the Fathers ſanctity more appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and
knowne.</p>
            <p n="10">10. It cannot eaſely be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued, how many things were
borne vp, and ſuſtayned with the ſhoulders of this diuine Giant, and with
what valour, <pb n="119" facs="tcp:16367:68"/>and ſpirit he ſuſtayned them,
eſpecially hauing ſo weake, and ſickly a body. For beſides the affaires
already mentioned which had byn ſufficient to weary many men, diuers
Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and perſons of all quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes, did write vnto him, from almoſt
all the parts, and Prouinces of the world. Some for their deuotion commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
themſelues to his prayers: others to benefit themſelues by his prudence and
wiſdome, demaundinge his counſell: others to help themſelues with his
fauour, and induſtry in diſpatching buſineſſe: others to giue him
thankes for the benefits, and good aſſiſtance receiued from his children:
and others for other reſpects. <pb n="120" facs="tcp:16367:69"/>And they were ſo many,
that only this emploiment had byn ſufficient to tyre any ſtrong man, if he
had not byn vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden by the mighty hand of our Lord, who gaue him forces for
all. So that when he was moſt weary, ſickly, and alone, and without the
helps which were neceſſary for ſo great a charge, he ſeemed moſt

as a poore man, among other of that quality, deſpiſed, and contemned and

ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les this affect of true humility helpeth more, then to ſhew au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
which hath ſome taſt, or ſauour of the world.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I heard him ſay, that al thoſe of the houſe gaue him
example of vertue, and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of confuſion, and that he was not
ſcandalized at any of them, but only at himſelfe. And in a letter, which I
haue ſeene, he wrot, that he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer treated with any of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
affayres, how great a ſinner ſoeuer he was, that he ſeemed not to haue
gayned much by that communication. Doubtles becauſe he eſteemed 
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:16367:78"/>himſelfe a greater ſinner. And to this purpoſe he
was wont to ſay, that he did not think, there was any in the world, who on
the one ſide recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſo great, and ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall fauours at Gods
hands: and on the other, was ſo de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fectiue, and careleſſe in his
ſeruice. One day, as we were togeather alone, he tould me, that he was to
beſeech our Lord, that his body after his death might be caſt vpon a
dunghill, that it might be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by foules, and doggs. <hi>For I being</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>as I am, an abhominable dunghill, yea very dung it ſelfe,

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. He deſyred, that all <pb n="139" facs="tcp:16367:78"/>ſhould
ieſt, and mock at him, and ſaid, that if he would ſuffer himſelfe to be
caryed away by his feruour, and deſire, he ſhould goe vp, and downe the
ſtreets naked, and al bemyred, that he might be accounted a foole. But he
repreſſed this ſo great an affect of Humility with his charity, and
deſyre to helpe his neighbours. Very ſeldome (and then not with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out great
cauſe) did he ſpeake of any thing belonging to himſelfe, and when others

               </gap> ſpeake of them in his

preſently recollected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not without feares, and bluſhing.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Bleſſed Father <pb n="140" facs="tcp:16367:79"/>had at one tyme
for his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſarius an ancient Father of the Society, of the Kingdome of
Nauar, who was called Don Diego Eguia, ſo perfect, and holy a man, that our
Father himſelfe ſaid vnto me: when we ſhalbe in Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Don Die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go wilbe
ſo far eleuated aboue vs, that we ſhall ſcarſe be able to ſee him.
This Father ſpake moſt earneſtly of the vertue, and ſanctity of our B.
Father, as one who knew his conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and the purity, and the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of
his ſoul. The B. Father tooke this very ill, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded him in vertue of
holy obedience, that he ſhould not ſpeake any word therof ſo long as he
lyued, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to repreſſe him, he left <pb n="141" facs="tcp:16367:79"/>of
confeſſing with him. And the holy ould man was wont to ſay, that he
deſired to liue ſome dayes after the death of our Father, that he might
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, what he knew; but our Lord ſo ordayned, that he died three dayes
before, and as it was thought, at the requeſt of our Bleſſed Father.</p>
            <p n="6">6. He arriued by Gods grace to ſo great, and perfect a
knowledge of himſelfe, that for many yeares before his death, he had not any
tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vayne glory. For his ſoule was ſo illuſtrated with light
from heauen, that he was wont to ſay, that he feared no vice leſſe then
vayne glory, which is a worme, wont to eat, and conſume the Cedars 
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:16367:80"/>of Libanus, and is bred by the blynd loue, and
eſtimation of our ſelues. All that belonged vnto him ſauoured of
Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: his apparell was poore though cleanly, his bed poore, his food &amp;
ſuſtenance poore, and ſo ſober and temperate, that it was a perpetuall
abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, being alſo courſe, and homely. He imploied himſelfe
willingly in the moſt humble offices of the houſe, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the
beds, and dreſſing vp the chambers of the ſicke: and he ſuffered
himſelfe to be ſo eaſily ruled by the iudgment of others, that though he
were Superiour, yet he equalled himſelfe in all things to his inferiors; yea
he did not only equall, but alſo ſubmit, and <pb n="143" facs="tcp:16367:80"/>ſubiect
himſelfe vnto them, with admirable meekenes, &amp; humility.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In the tyme that he taught the Catechiſme, or Chriſtian
Doctrine, a boy, which was in the houſe told him with great plaineſſe and
ſimplicity, that he ſpake bad Italian, and that he ſhould do wel to
labour to ſpeak better. To whom the Father anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. <hi>Thou haſt good
reaſon, Boy, I pray thee note my faultes, and tell me of them.</hi> One of
the cauſes why he deſired to haue his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion called the SOCIETY OF
IESVS, was, not to be named, and mentioned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and that it might be
thought, that he had no part in it: and when he ſpake of <pb n="144" facs="tcp:16367:81"/>it, he alwayes ſaid <hi>this leaſt Society:</hi> for as he was the
leaſt in his owne eyes, ſo he would haue his children to eſteeme
themſelues ſuch. Now what ſhall I ſay of that Humility, with which ſo
earneſtly, and ſo often he refuſed to be Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and would neuer
accept that Office, vntill his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſarius charged his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience and
obliged him therunto?</p>
            <p n="8">8. Neither was he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with this, but afterward alſo in
the yeare 1550. he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the graueſt Fathers of the Society to meete in
Rome, that he might reſigne his Charge, proteſting before our Lord, and
affirming in a letter, which he wrote vnto them, that he had many, and diuers 
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:16367:81"/>tymes ſeriouſly iudged, that he wanted in a manner
infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nito degrees of thoſe parts, and talents which were required in him, who
ſhould haue that Charge, and Office. For theſe were his very wordes:
Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as all wee who were acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him, knew, that he had ſo great,
and notable a gift in gouerning, that all the excellent Superiours of
Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions might take him for a patterne, and example. And though he could not
obtayne his deſire at this tyme, yet he omitted not to treat of the ſame
renunciation againe, that he might retyre himſelfe, aſwell to giue
himſelfe with more freedome to contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and enioy by
ſolitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <pb n="146" facs="tcp:16367:82"/>his ſoueraigne Good, as alſo
becauſe (as he tould me) it ſeemed to him, that he was good for nothing,
and that he hindred ſome other from gouerning the Society, who might profit
it more. But he went not forward with his intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at this tyme: for he was
told, that the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety would in no ſort yield vnto it, nor conſent to haue
any other Superiour, ſo long as it pleaſed God to prolong his life.</p>
            <p n="9">9. From this ſo excellent humility proceeded the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of himſelfe,<note place="margin">His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world &amp; forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in
tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> and of the world, and all wordly things which this
Bleſſed Father had. For he who is truly humble, deſireth to be humbled,
and <pb n="147" facs="tcp:16367:82"/>taketh humiliation, as S. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard ſaith, for a
meanes to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne humility. From the ſame humility likewiſe came his
fortitude in troubles, and his patience in aduerſities, and tribulations. For
he, who is truly humble, dwelling with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelfe, accounteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
ſo great a ſinner, and ſo vnworthy of comfort, that he thinketh all to be
to much for him, and that no euill happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vnto him, which ſeemeth not
litle in compariſon of that which he deſerueth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyceth to ſee all
creatures take reuenge of him, as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the diuine Iuſtice.</p>

            <p>NOvv what ſhall I ſay of the mortification of his paſſions,
and of all inordinate affections, by which he had obtayned an admirable peace
in his ſoul, and ſo great quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and tranquillity, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſeemed able to diſturbe him?<note place="margin">The mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his
paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> His complexion was very cholerike, but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
both in his words, and workes he was ſo mild, and ſweet, that he ſeemed
ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther flegmatike, and of a cold complexion. So that hauing wholy ouercome the
vicious <pb n="149" facs="tcp:16367:83"/>exceſſe of his choler, he retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the
efficacy, and force which it is wont to giue, and is neceſſary for the
execution of ſuch buſines, as we deale in. He alwayes kept one, and the
ſame tenour, and equality in all things: and although that of his body
varied, yet his mind, and inward diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition was alwayes one: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was
he altered or chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with any diuerſity of things, or difference of tymes.
Yea this equality of mynd, and perpetuall conſtancy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounded in ſome
ſort to his body, which was ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue that outward demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
which reaſon preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Being once ſicke, the <pb n="150" facs="tcp:16367:84"/>Phiſitian
aduiſed him, that he ſhould not giue place to ſuch thoughts, as might
afflict him. And with this occaſion he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to examine, what thing in this
world could cauſe him affliction; and after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of many
things he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this only one: If by ſome caſuality our Society ſhould be
diſſolued; and withall it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to him that if this fell out without
his fault, after a little recollection in prayer for the ſpace of one quarter
of an houre, he ſhould returne to his accuſtomed peace, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacrity. Yea
he added further, that he ſhould haue his peace and quietnes in his ſoule,
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought the Society were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, as ſalt in the water. 
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:16367:84"/>How wholy then had he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken himſelfe, and rooted
himſelfe in God, who in ſo great a matter, and ſo proper, and peculiar to
himſelfe was ſo ſubiect, and reſigned to the will of our Lord? Which is
an euident ſigne, that his paſſions were prefectly mortifyed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By this mortification,<note place="margin">His cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God.</note> and by that perfect knowledg, and contempt which he had of
himſelfe, this Bleſſed man, attayned to a moſt high, and excellent
degree of charity, which is the ſumme of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and the complement of
all perfection. This his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and enflamed loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, appeared in
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better, then in that, which he did, and ſuffered for 
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:16367:85"/>him. For true loue is neuer idle, and is not content with
only doing much for his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but in ſuffering much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and giuing
his life for him. How much then did this Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Father, and what great
things did he ſuffer for our Lords honour, and to amplify his glory in the
world? Part of it may be coniectured by that, which hitherto hath byn
ſaid.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But the Father himſelfe auouched, that all the things of
the world put togeather in one ballance, were to him of no eſteeme, if in the
other were placed the fanours which he had receyued of our Lord, in the
perſecutions, priſons, and fetters which he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured 
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:16367:85"/>for his loue. And that there is no created thing, which
can cauſe ſo great a ioy in a ſoule, as that is, which ſhe receiueth in
hauing ſuffred for Chriſt. To which purpoſe being demaunded by a Father,
which was the ſhorteſt, and moſt certayne, and ſecure way to attayne
perfection: he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that to endure many, and very great aduerſityes
for the loue of Chriſt. <hi>Aske</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>this grace of our Lord,
for to whom he doth it, he doth many more togeather, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned in
it.</hi> Thus the Bleſſed Father both did himſelfe, and taught others, by
which we may gather his great chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But we haue other more <pb n="154" facs="tcp:16367:86"/>cleare
arguments of this his loue to God, and to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours for the loue of God.
The ſcope to which all his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, cares, and intentions were directed, was
<hi>Gods grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter glory.</hi> For he contented not himſelfe, that God were
not offended in that he did, but procured that he might be glorified. And when
two things of Gods ſeruice offered themſelues vnto him, he did alwayes
chooſe that, out of which he thought <hi>Gods greater glory</hi> would
enſue. And this was, as we haue ſaid, alwaies his Poeſy: and to this
ſcope he alwaies aymed. Many times ſpeaking with God from the inmoſt of
his hart, he ſaid vnto him: <hi>O Lord, what do I <pb n="155" facs="tcp:16367:86"/>deſire, or can I deſire beſides thee?</hi> And his deſire to
ſee him, and to be diſſolued from the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his body, was ſo
great and ardent, that when he thought on his death he could not refrayne from
teares, which diſtilled from his eyes for pure ioy. And this not only to
obtayne that ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne good for himſelfe, but much more to behold the
glory of that moſt ſacred hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of the ſame Lord, whom he loued ſo
greatly; as a friend is wont to reioyce to ſee the honour, and glory of him,
whome he hartily loueth.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In the yeare 1541. in the moneth of Iuly (I being
preſent) he ſayd, that if our <pb n="156" facs="tcp:16367:87"/>Lord God would giue him
his choiſe, eyther preſently to depart out of this life, and to enioy
eternall happynes, or to remaine in the world, without hauing ſecurity to
perſeuere in vertue; he would chooſe this ſecond, if he might
vnderſtand, that by remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for ſome ſpace in this life, he could doe
ſome great, and notable ſeruice for his Maieſty, caſting his eyes v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
God, and not vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, nor reſpecting his owne danger, or ſecurity.
And he added the cauſe: for what King (ſaid he) or Prince is there in the
world, who if offering ſome great reward to one of his ſeruants, he
ſhould refuſe to enioy it preſently, that <pb n="157" facs="tcp:16367:87"/>he might
doe ſome notable ſeruice for his Prince, would not thinke himſelfe
obliged to conſerue, yea increaſe the reward of that ſeruant, ſince he
depriued himſelfe of it for his loue, and that he might be able to doe him
more ſeruice? And if me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proceed in this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, what are we to hope for of
our Lord? or how can we feare, that he will forſake vs, or permit vs to fall,
for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing prolonged our happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; differred to enioy him for his
ſake? Let others thinke ſo if they pleaſe (ſaid he) for I will not
conceiue ſo hardly of ſo good a God, and ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and ſoueraigne a
King.</p>
            <p n="7">7. There came one tyme to his mind a thought, what 
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:16367:88"/>he ſhould thinke, if God ſhould put him in hell: and
he explicated his conceit in a paper written with his owne hand in this manner:
<hi>There were two things repreſented vnto me: the one, what paines I should
ſuffer there: the other, how his Name was blaſpemed. In the firſt I could
not feele, nor find any affliction: and ſo me thought, and it was
repreſented vnto me, that my greateſt mole ſtatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould be to heare
his holy Name bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemed.</hi> Theſe are his very words. Now what an
enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med loue did he beare to our Lord, who found this effect, and
diſpoſition in himſelfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him? What flames of heauenly fire burned
in that breaſt, ſince that thoſe of the <pb n="159" facs="tcp:16367:88"/>fire of hell
could not quench them, nor make him feele af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction in his owne paynes, but
only in the iniury, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his beloued?</p>

            <p n="2">2. In Paris he deſired to deliuer a wicked man, who kept a
Concubine, from that euill eſtate; and diuers reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which he had put in
practice, taking no effect, he went one day into a Lake of exceeding colde

care not to render any man euill, but ſtriued to do good to his
perſecutors, procuring that his benefits towards them ſhould be greater,
then the euills, &amp; iniuries which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from them. One of his fellow
ſchollers who remai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned in the ſame houſe with <pb n="162" facs="tcp:16367:90"/>him
in Paris, ran away with certaine money, which was ſent in almes to the B.
Father, and was committed to his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody. Afterward this man being in Roan,
fell dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly ſick, and knowing the Fathers charity, wrote vnto him, in
what afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was, requeſting him to take ſome order for his reliefe.
The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hauing made much and earneſt prayer for him, went preſently to
Roan (which is 28. leagues from Paris) to find him our, &amp; help him in what
he could, and with great ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity of ſpirit, and force of mind, he went in
three dayes thoſe 28. leagues barefoot, without eating one bit of bread, or
drinking one drop <pb n="163" facs="tcp:16367:90"/>of water, offering this labour and
penance to our Lord, for the health and life of him, who had deceiued him in
that manner.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another likewiſe, who in Paris had receiued much charity
at the holy Fathers hands, aſſaulted by Sathan, &amp; becomming as it were
furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, reſolued to kill him, and being gone vp the ſtayres for that
purpoſe heard a dreadfull voyce, which ſaid vnto him: <hi>Thou wretch what
wilt thou do?</hi> who terrified with this voice, caſt himſelf at the
Fathers feet weeping, and related vnto him, what his purpoſe was. The Father
cheriſhed, and comforted him; but his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and meeknes was not

being paſt (to requite good for euill) the Father receiued him into the

he perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not in his vocation. If the B. Father dealt thus with
ſtrangers, and with thoſe that pretended to do him iniury, what maruaile is
there, that he vſed the ſame charity vvith his ſubiects, and
children?</p>
            <pb n="165" facs="tcp:16367:91"/>
            <p n="5">5. One of the nine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which came vnto him in Paris,
being much afflicted &amp; diſquieted with a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and dangerous
tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo that he was in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner loſt; the B. Father deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered him
from that danger, by weeping bitterly, &amp; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God continually for
him, without eating, or drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in three whole dayes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching our Lord
to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and ſtrengthen him and ſo he did. Another tyme ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Father
was much out of order, exceeding the bounds of reaſon, by which meanes the
holy Father was much grieued, and afflicted for the harme, which the other
recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. The reuenge which he <pb n="166" facs="tcp:16367:92"/>procured, was to put
himſelfe in prayer, and to ſhed many teares for him, and ſaying
Maſſe, from the bottome of his hart, he cryed, and ſighed vnto our Lord,
ſaying: <hi>Pardon him, O Lord, Pardon him, my Creator, for he knoweth not
what he doth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Another tyme a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Society, being grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly
tempted in his voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and reſolued to forſake God, who is the fountayne
of liuing waters, and returne to drinke of the broken ciſternes of the world,
which containe no water of grace, nor of true repoſe; the Father
vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that the cauſe of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation was the ſhame, that
the brother had to confeſſe a <pb n="167" facs="tcp:16367:92"/>ſinne which he had
commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he went vnto him, and declared his former life, and how blynd he
had byn in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the vanity of his ſenſes and how much addicted to the
falſe loue of creatures, that by this meanes the Brother might be leſſe
aſhamed, and learne to haue a true co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and mercy of our
Lord.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Now what ſhall I ſay of the meekeneſſe,<note place="margin">His meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp; benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe who were
vnder his charge.</note> and benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which he vſed towards all men, &amp;
eſpecially to thoſe, that were vnder his charge? Of the care he had,
leaſt they ſhould be ouerlayd? Of the ſweetenes wherewith he
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to the weake: ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thoſe that were fallen: comforted the
afflicted: en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged <pb n="168" facs="tcp:16367:93"/>the faint-harted: and tooke
compaſſion of the diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſickly? For certainly it was a thing
which cauſed admiration, to ſee the care that he vſed, for the cure, and
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the ſicke. And he told me ſometymes, that our Lord had with
particuler proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence prouided that he ſhould haue ſo little and vnperfect
health, that by his owne ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; infirmityes, he might learne to
eſteeme thoſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and take compaſſion of the weake.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Being in Vincenza ſick of an ague, he vnderſtood, that
Father Symon Roderi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quez, one of the Fathers, was in Baſſana (about a dayes
iourney from Vincenza) very <pb n="169" facs="tcp:16367:93"/>ſick, and in danger of
death: and preſently the B. Father tooke his iourney towards Baſſana, in
the company of Father Faber, to viſit, and comfort Father Symon, and he went
with ſuch courage, and force of ſpirit, that Father Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber could not follow
him. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other tyme, being on the way, Father Laynes, who was with him fell
ſudainly into a very great payne, for remedy wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Father preſently
ſought him, an horſe, giuing ſix pence for him, which was all the money
they had gotten of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and wrapping him in his poore thrid-bare cloke he
ſet him vp, and ran before him with ſuch alacrity, &amp; lightnes, that
Father Laynes told me, <pb n="170" facs="tcp:16367:94"/>he could ſcarce keep him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
being on horsbacke.</p>
            <p n="9">9. But he diſcouered this his Fatherly loue towards his
children in nothing more then in prouiding for their good name, and
ſpirituall pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fit, and in burying in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall obliuion ſuch faults as
they committed, eyther by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane frailty, or negligence, when they
themſelues did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg them with ſorrow, and deſire of amendement
With this, and other louing, and Fatherly proceedings he did win the harts of
all his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and might do with them what he would, they were ſo
ſubiect, tractable, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to his will; and he p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them to his imitation in all <pb n="171" facs="tcp:16367:94"/>perfection, and in that pure, ſincere, and diuine loue of our Lord
in which it conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Notwithſtanding this loue towards his children was not
feeble and remiſſe, but ſweet and ſtrong,<note place="margin">The
Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers loue was ſweet &amp; ſtrong.</note> mild and ſeuere. For as he
was ſweete, and gentle with the humble and obedient: ſo he was terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to
the rebellious, and ſtiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necked, hauing great care to further his ſubiects
in vertue, and encourage them to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, vſing euery one mildly, or
ſeuerely according to their capacity, but yet ſhewing loue to all. And he
was ſo dextrous in ioyning ſweetnes with ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that thought he
deſired much to haue all his children <pb n="172" facs="tcp:16367:95"/>indifferent in
matters of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, without inclination to any one thing more then to
another, notwithſtanding he examined the naturall diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of euery
one with great diligence, and applyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto them in all things,
wherein he ſaw them to be well giuen. For he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, how troubleſome
that is, which is done with natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall repugnance, and that no violent thing is
durable: ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing his religious ſeuerity in requiring indifferency, and his

ſpeak of that vertue which is the guide, and miſtreſſe of the reſt,
&amp; the paſſage, or conduct, by which our Lord imparteth his giftes to

            <p n="3">3. The Father himſelf co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that our Lord had
large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imparted vnto him the grace <pb n="177" facs="tcp:16367:97"/>of deuotion, which he

ſickly, &amp; wearyed, he was good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but to giue himſelfe wholy
to God. Preſently after he was made Prieſt; when he ſaid the Diuine
Office, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundannce of Gods comfort was ſo great, and the teares, which
he ſhed ſo many, that he was enforced to ſtay almoſt in euery word, and
to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the houres, or part of the office, which he ſaid: And this went
ſo far, that he had almoſt loſt his ſight with weeping<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In matters

ſo many probable reaſons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <pb n="178" facs="tcp:16367:98"/>he had commended
them to our Lord in Prayer. There was no houre in the day, in which he did not
inwardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect himſelfe, and ſetting aſide all other
buſineſſes, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined his conſcience: and if peraduenture ſome great,
or vrgent buſineſſe permitted him not to fullfil his deuotion in one
houre, he did preſently recompence it ſo ſoone as he might: albeit he
neuer gaue himſelfe ſo much to outward affayres, that he loſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
deuotion of his ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He had God alway preſent before his eyes in all things,
and they all ſerued him for a booke to read his diuine perfections in, and to
eleuate his hart to him, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="179" facs="tcp:16367:98"/>ſpirituall documents,
and profitable aduiſes out of euery thing that he did ſee; teaching that
this manner of prayer is very profitable for all, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally for thoſe who
are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in exteriour things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Gods ſeruice. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his
prayer he prepared his ſoule, and entred into the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory of his hart, and
there he inflamed himſelfe in ſuch ſort, that it appeared in his
countenance, and he ſeemed to be all ſet on fire, as we no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp;
diſcouered many tymes. He vſed ſuch attention in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, though
neuer ſo litle, belonging to his conuerſation with God, and he was ſo
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected, and preſent in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe when he did it, that he 
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:16367:99"/>ſeemed to behold the Maieſty of God preſent, as when
he ſaid grace before or after meat and in other like occaſions.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He had a very excellent gift of teares, which he ſhed in
great aboundance in his prayers, with great ioy of his ſpirit, and no
leſſe harme to his body; of which he made no account, that he might not
looſe the ſpirituall fruit of his ſoule. But finally ouercome with
reaſon, and becauſe the Phiſitians ſhewed him, how much that continuall
effuſion of teares did hurt his health, he beſeeched our Lord to giue him
the maiſtery, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund ouer them. And he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned it ſo entirely,
that he ſeemed to haue them in his <pb n="181" facs="tcp:16367:99"/>hand to ſhed, or
repreſſe them when, and how it pleaſed him. And this with to great fauour
of the diuine Mercy, that though his eyes were dry, yet his ſpirit remayned
alwayes moiſt, and his heauenly illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations were not diminiſhed, how
much ſoeuer his teares were moderated by reaſon but their fruit remained in
all force and vigour. No noiſe, how great ſoeuer it were, did trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or
hinder him in his prayer if he had giuen no occaſion therof. But any
obſtacle what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer was an impediment vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, if it were in his power
to auoid it, ſo that, it was not the noiſe, but the negligence, which he
ſeemed to haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, in not taking away, <pb n="182" facs="tcp:16367:100"/>that

moſt B. Trinity, the Diuine Eſſence, the diſtinction and propriety of
the three Perſons was ſo continuall, excellent, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract, that the

manner. With this light, he vnderſtood very perfectly many things, aſwell
of thoſe which appertayned to the myſteries of our faith, as of other,
which belong to the knowledge of ſciences: in ſo much, that the ſame

was held for dead: and they had buryed him, if they had not diſcerned that

               </gap>yn, <pb n="216" facs="tcp:16367:117"/>which was in the yeare 1572. I had notice of ſome other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
of the holy Father, then thoſe that I there ſet downe: yet I knew them not
ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, that I thought it fit to publiſh them: but ſince, with the
authenticall informations which haue byn taken for his Canonization, they haue
byn proued by ſufficient witneſſes: and our Lord, who will exalt and make
him glorious vpon earth doth euery day ſo many miracles by his meanes, that I
am obliged to declare ſome part of them heere, taking them out of the
Authenticall and Iuridicall Informations which many Prelates haue made, and are
at this tyme in my hands; and out of the de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſitions, <pb n="217" facs="tcp:16367:117"/>which the partyes themſelues, on whom theſe miracles haue byn
wrought, haue made vnder their corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call oaths, &amp; by the teſtimony of

            <p n="2">2. Firſt then, he had great dominion, and commaund ouer the
Diuels, and they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred, and perſecuted him, as theyr cruell enemy;
fearing him in that reſpect and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to be ſo. For in the tyme

appeared vnto him many tymes in a ſhy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and beautifull figure till at

would deceiue him. And not only in Manreſa, but alſo in his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes, 
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:16367:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>and at Parys, &amp; Rome, he appeared many tymes
vnto him, but ſo contemptible, and deformed, that not making any account of
him, he did eaſely driue him away with the ſtaffe which he had in his hand
(as if he had byn a cat, or a little dogge:) This malignant ſpirit procured
to terrify him whilſt he remayned in the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall of Lewis de Antecan<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>a
in Alcala, but he could not preuaile. He would alſo haue choked him another
tyme at Rome in his ſleep, &amp; he throt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him in ſuch ſort, that he
was inforced to inuocate, and call vpon the ſweet name of Ieſus, with ſo
great a force, that he remayned hoarſe many dayes after.</p>

            <p n="3">3. Another tyme being in his bed, the Diuells did ſtrike and

(and told me of it) heard him, and roſe twice to helpe, and aſſiſt him;
but they could do him no harme, becauſe our Lord permitted them not. They
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted him their mortal ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who made cruell warre v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, &amp;
tooke the ſoules out of their clawes; and they publiſhed many tymes, that

            <p n="4">4. In the yeare 1541. I my ſelfe heard a Diuell, which
tormented a poore young man in Rome called Matthew, ſay, that he deſired vs

and tempeſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, which argued their great anger, and malice; but
by the grace of our Lord, he ouercame them all, &amp; ſubdued them with ſo

deliuered. At Rome, he cured that forſaid young man, called Matthew, who was

notable a thing There were in that Citty of Modena foure ſiſters, noble,
and honeſt women, one wherof was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed, &amp; the other three mayds: al
which, together with a niece of theirs (likewiſe a maide) were for many
yeares tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a great multitude of malignant ſpirits: &amp; this
with ſuch rigour, that it was a very pitifull thing to ſee the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,
&amp; diuers vexatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually ſuffered of the Diuells. They
were ordinarily very ſickly, the Phiſitians not knowing how to cure them
being ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of their ſicknes; <pb n="235" facs="tcp:16367:126"/>ſometymes the
Diuells caryed them to high places, to caſt them downe headlong; and other
tymes to the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot places of the houſe, when ſhutting the Dores
they rent theyr garments, pulled of the haire from their heads, beating them,
and caſting them to the ground, with danger of their liues; neither did they
leaue miſuſing them in this manner vntill thoſe of the houſe, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the noiſe, came to help them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All of them being ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous women, brought vp in the feare
of God, and very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt in theyr words, they were many tymes inforced by
thoſe infernall beaſts, to vtter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemely ſpeaches, and horrible

ſhoutes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as amazed all that heard them. They could not without great
violence apply themſelues to prayer, nor ſay, nor heare any word in the
praiſe of God. It was an intollerable thing for them to be at Maſſe, and
there the Diuells made them ſound, and fall to the ground, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king outryes,
&amp; ſhouting with ſuch violence, that they could ſcarcely conteyne
themſelues. VVhen they went to confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they hindred them from
telling their ſinns, &amp; bereaued them of their forces, making them to
faynt, and cauſing them to put out their tongues after a foule manner, in
moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery of the Holy Sacrament of <pb n="237" facs="tcp:16367:127" rendition="simple:additions"/>Confeſſion,
and of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours. But that which tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented them moſt, were the
motions, and temptations of the fleſh, which continually afflicted them. For
they were very honeſt women, and ſome of them had dedicated their virginity
to God by vow. And the Diuels themſelues, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by the exorciſmes of
the Church, confeſſed, that their intent was to depriue them of their
chaſtity, and to put them in danger of looſing both their ſpirituall, and
corporal health: but that they had laboured in vayne by reaſon of the vſe
of the Sacraments, with which theſe good women defended themſelues, when
they were moſt of all afflicted.</p>
            <pb n="238" facs="tcp:16367:128"/>
            <p n="3">3. Furthermore, theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernall ſpirits not being
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to afflict them ſo many wayes, enraged with excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great fury,
to ſee that weake women made them ſo great reſiſtance, they killed the
only ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of the maryed ſiſter, who was but 14. months old &amp; before
they murthered him they threatned her, that they would kill him vpon ſuch a
certayne day, and ſo the child dyed at the tyme appointed, to the great
griefe of his Mother, and of all the family. (How ſecret, and profound are
the iudgments of our Lord!) Theſe deuout, &amp; afflicted wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had taken

themſelues <pb n="239" facs="tcp:16367:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>from this tyranny of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes of

excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and prudence, that they as good Phiſitians might help, and

            <p n="4">4. Father Rector of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Society of Ieſus,
which is in the Citty of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena, hauing vnderſtood the pittifull caſe of
thoſe poore women, after he had throughly conſidered, and commended it to
our Lord, by his inſtinct (as the effect declared) went one day to the

egregiouſly, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, bald, lame, &amp; blynd: &amp; being preſſed
by the Prieſt who exorciſed them, to tel the reaſon why they called him
ſo: they anſwered that they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him bald, becauſe he had not much
hayre on his head nor beard; and lame, becauſe <pb n="243" facs="tcp:16367:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>his leggs were not of the ſame length, one of them hauing beene
broken; and blynd, by reaſon of his aboundance of teares, wherby he had been
in great danger to looſe his ſight: &amp; they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>playned, that he came
ſo farre, as Spayne, to perſecute them both in his life, and after his
death. And at the ſame tyme many principall Diuels departed with horrible
roarings from one of the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, leauing her almoſt dead, and
confeſſing the vertue of Ignatius.</p>
            <p n="5">5. By this meanes the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid ſiſters, theyr mother,
and all the houſe conceyued great deuotion towards the Bleſſed Father,
with hope by his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to obtayne the health <pb n="244" facs="tcp:16367:131"/>which they deſyred; and they made a vow to obſerue holy all the
dayes of their life, the day of his death, and to faſt the Eue. This deuotion
increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with another new acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, for a Father of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety called
Auguſtine Viualdi, being come at that tyme from Rome to preach in Modena,
brought with him a reliquary, in which among other, he had a relique of the B.
Father, which being placed ſecretly, and without ſaying any thing to any
body, in the roome where the ſiſters were, the Diuels cryed out, ſaying:
that it was the Relique of Ignati', telling from whence it came, and who had
brought it: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the intolerable torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <pb n="245" facs="tcp:16367:131"/>which
they ſuffered, and that by his interceſſion they ſhould all be caſt
forth of thoſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: For God had determined to glorify him in the
world.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Another day a great Diuell hauing mocked and blaſphemed
at Ignatius before his going out, being inforced by God at the tyme of his
de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>parture, confeſſed to his great confuſion, that he was burnt with that
little peece of bonet and he called him three tymes a Saynt, ſaying: S
Ignatius, S. Ignatius, S. Ignatius ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſteth me forth by his humility and
patience, and by the deuo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, which he had to the moſt Holy Virgin. Other
times, the Diuells deſvring to conceale that they were caſt 
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:16367:132"/>out by the prayers of B. Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, attributing that
effect to the vertue of other Saynts, to whom the ſaid ſiſters had
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler deuotion, at the tyme of theyr going out, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe the lye which they had told, and to giue the glory to Ignatius,
ſaying: that God would ſerue himſelfe of him alone, in that
occaſion.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Other tymes with great fury, at theyr departure, they cryed
out, ſaying: where is thy might O Lucifer, ſince that a peece of paper,
with the picture of this Prieſt caſteth vs forth, thou not being able to
make reſiſtance? And many tymes hauing beene exorciſed the whole day
without profit, they ſaid, that they ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

called v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, becauſe God would haue it ſo. And when the Prieſt ſaid,
<hi>Impero vobis per merita B. Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tij &amp;c.</hi> I command you by the
merits of B. Ignatius &amp;c they preſently went away with great rage, and
fury. Other tymes they ſaid: O God how doeſt thou depriue vs of glory, to

            <p n="8">8. The ſame effects which the Picture and Relique of the
Bleſſed Father had wrought, were likewiſe cauſed by the booke written
of his life: for it being caryed to the womens houſe, for them to read vpon,
and layd vpon their head, or breaſt, or ſome Chapter of his

to yeald themſelues to the wil of God, who is meruailous in his Saynts, and
giueth them ſtrength and vertue to tread vpon Lyons, and to triumph ouer al
the powers of hel. This battayle and contention, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted for two months, at
which tyme the perfect victory was obtayned. For as S. Bernard ſaith,
ſpeaking of a Diuell, which S. Malachy caſt out of two women; this delay
was not for want of power in the Saynt, but by diuine diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, that
the preſence of the enemy, and the victory of the Saynt, who caſt them
forth, might be the better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>

were wonderfull and ſeemed more then humane, mouing mens harts, not with the
ſweetnes or elega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of his ſpeach, but with the weight of his ſpirit,

meruailed at themſelues, and at the change, which they had made. With two or

            <p n="2">2. There was in our houſe at Rome a Iew, called Iſaac, to

fell one day into a great temptation, and as one that were furious, and

Iſaac:</hi> preſently he was quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and of a furious Lyon became a

            <p n="3">3. A brother called Iohn Paul, who accompanyed our Bleſſed

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:16367:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>that he ſeemed a lyuing ſtatua of death. He
imparted this his trouble to our Bleſſed Father, who with only two words,
in anſwere, tooke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as with his hand, all that perplexity, and agony,
and pulled vp the rootes of it ſo perfectly, as if he had neuer endured any
ſuch matter.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I knew another alſo (whom I will not name be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he

our B. Father with that paſſion, and vayne feare, he with two words, that

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:16367:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>There happened two other things to the ſame man,
which do very well declare the efficacy, which God gaue to the words of this
his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, and what force he had to moue their harts, who trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him.
The one is, that being once very rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and obſtinate, in not

to cry out a loud, <hi>I will do it Father, I will doe it.</hi> And ſo he
did, it ſeeming to him, that he had not power to do otherwiſe, by reaſon
of the great motion, and impulſion, which he felt in his ſoule</p>
            <pb n="254" facs="tcp:16367:136"/>
            <p n="5">5. The other was that the ſame brother being tempted, and in
a manner reſolued not to perſeuere in the Society, and making his generall
Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with the Bleſſed Father, with only theſe words, that he
ſaid vnto him, <hi>I deſire you, not to be vngratefull to one who hath done

a man of ſuch ſanctity, and <pb n="255" facs="tcp:16367:136"/>prudence as is knowne,
was wont to ſay, that B. Father Ignatius did ſpeake, <hi>tamquam

what he would, and to moue them to what he would.</p>
            <p n="6">6. S. Bernard ſaith, that the holy Biſhop S. Malachy tamed

            <p n="14">14. But yet more notable is that which happened in the ſame
Citty, in the moneth of Nouember following, to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected Virgin of the age

great force, and violence, that it depriued her of her iudgment, and many

beating her ſelfe: and when ſhe was out of this fit, ſhe remayned with
ſuch a terrible payne of her hart, and ſo great affliction of mynd, her

follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, ſhe could not moue her ſelfe, nor do any thing. But hauing
vnderſtood of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, which our Lord did in this tyme in diuers places
by the interceſſion of the Bleſſed Father; one night when her
diſeaſe had aſſayled her more fiercely and violently, then at other

inſtant, ſhe found her ſelfe altogeather well, and as ſound, and free
from that ſadnes, and payne of her hart, and from the other accidents with
which ſhe had remained all that tyme, as ſhe was wont at other tymes
before. She ſlept, and repoſed that night very well (which ſhe could not
do at other tymes, when ſhe had thoſe fits) and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo ſoone
as it was day, ſhe roſe out of her bed, whereat her ſiſter, and
brother-in-law meruailed to ſee her goe vp and downe the houſe. She bad
them not wonder, but giue thankes to our Lord, who by <pb n="297" facs="tcp:16367:158"/>meanes of B. Father Ignatius had giuen her moſt perfect health,
ſo that ſhe had not ſo much as any ſigne of her ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. After
eight, or tenne dayes, the ſame mayd fell into ſuch an extreme fit of the
Cholicke,<note place="margin">Alſo the cholike.</note> that ſhe expected
death: and with the deuotion, which ſhe had conceiued to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the
Bleſſed Father, ſhe commended her ſelfe to him, and preſently
remayned alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather free from that payne alſo. And in token of
acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, ſhe came to the Church of the Society, and brought two

another, which God hath wrought in the ſame Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of late, vpon the 12. of
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember of this laſt yeare 1600. A Girle of 7. yeares old was ſo ſick
of an ague, and a ſwelling in her face, that for two dayes, and two nights
ſhe could take no reſt, nor drinke ſo much as one drop of water, ſo
that her pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts thought rather of bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, then of curing her. One of the
childs Aunts ſaw by chance a picture of Bleſſed Father Ignatius,<note place="margin">A child healed of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue and ſweel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the face.</note>
which had byn brought to her Father, that he might ſet it in a frame (for he

great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, bidding her commend her ſelfe to that Saint, and to

of an houre, the child called her mother, and told her, that ſhe was ſound
and well, and that the holy Father Ignatius had healed her, deſiring her to
giue her ſome thing to eate. She did eate, drink, and ſleepe that night, as
one that was perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly well; and forthwith the day following, ſhe and her
Aunt went to the Colledge of the Society, to giue our Lord thankes, and began
to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the deuotion promiſed, and preſented a picture of wax.</p>

            <p n="4">4. Magdalen Suau wife to Peter Suau, endured for three dayes
moſt terrible paynes of child-bearing, and vpon S. Laurence his day, in the
yeare 1598. the ſubſcription which we haue mentioned of the Bleſſed
Father, being brought vnto her, whileſt ſhe was in that diſtreſſe in
her bed, ſhe roſe out of it, and after a new manner, all that were
preſent <pb n="303" facs="tcp:16367:161"/>calling vpon the name of Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Ignatius,
ſhe was deliuered of a child, hauing his head gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing betwixt his leggs. And
yet our Lord vouchſafed to preſerue the mother, who was very faynt and
weake, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hurt or harme; the child alſo being fayre, and in good
health, which cauſed all the ſtanders by to praiſe our Lord, for the
wayes which he taketh to honour his Saints. With theſe, and other like
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents the fame of the fauour which God our Lord doth to women in
childbirth, by the merits of Father Ignatius was ſo ſpread abroad, that
both poore, and rich, when they found themſelues in that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, did take

            <p n="5">5. Another woman, called Ieronyma Rebaça, was many

which ſhe ſuffered in child-bearing, being alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding weake and

was dead (becauſe it moued not) they would haue giuen her a certayne ſtrong

vpon the 20. of October of the ſame yeare 1598. and within halfe a quarter of
an houre ſhe was deliuered of a ſonne, being aliue, and in good health. And
that which cauſed moſt admiration was, that the child had his mouth full of
the potions, which the mother had taken three dayes before. The midwife tooke
them out of his mouth, and the child preſently cryed, which made all the
reſt to laugh for ioy.</p>
            <p n="6">6. One of the women, <pb n="306" facs="tcp:16367:163"/>which was preſent

any remedy which could mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate the ſame, and togeather with this, ſhe was
troubled with a looſe tooth, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her much payne when ſhe did

of ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, and dangerous a double tertian ague, that hauing
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, and receyued, he loſt his iudgment the fourth day, his toung
was thicke, his eyes holow and cloudy, togeather with the other accidents and

the Bleſſed Father vpon him, beſeeching our <pb n="308" facs="tcp:16367:164"/>Lord
with much deuotion, &amp; teares to graunt the ſicke man his health. And at
that very inſtant the ague was quite ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, &amp; he recouered his
iudgment and ſpeach, and his eyes became cleare. And this being at eight of

him (thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that he would be either dead, or in his laſt agony) he found

that he could not take any reſt eyther day, or night. He loſt the ſight

could not endure any glimpſe of light. The Phiſitians had giuen him ouer

            <p>BVT though the miracles, which are here related, &amp; many other,
which I omit for <pb n="324" facs="tcp:16367:172"/>breuity, be ſo great, &amp; ſo
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne; notwithſtanding the greateſt of all (in my opinion) is, that God
hath choſen this Bleſſed Father to inſtitute, gouerne, and extend an
Order of Religion, which amongſt Catholikes, Heretickes, and Infidells, hath
in ſo ſhort a ſpace done ſo much good in the world. And this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
is ſo great, and ſo noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, that although there were no other, this
alone ought to be ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to know and eſteeme the ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctity which our
Lord hath giuen to this venerable Father. Synce it is certayne, that when our
Lord chooſeth one for any great matter, he giueth him ſuch grace and
talents, as are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary <pb n="325" facs="tcp:16367:172"/>for the conuenient
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, &amp; accompliſhment therof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And I think that any wiſe, and vnpaſſionate man will
iudge the ſame, if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the alteration, which God made, changing
Ignatius from a worldly, and vayne ſouldiar, &amp; making him Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn of
this Sacred Warfarre, and Father of ſo many, and ſuch eminent Children. He
that ſhal think vpon the hard wayes, by which he guided him, and the
perſeuerance, &amp; victory, that he gaue him: what company he ioyned to him
in Paris, ſome being Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, and others Frenchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, at the very tyme that
Spayne and France were at cruell <pb n="326" facs="tcp:16367:173"/>wars: and how he vnited,
and bound them together with the band of perfect charity. The perſecutions,
&amp; ſtormes, which this Veſſel hath endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, from the tyme that our
Lord launched it into the ſea, and that it hath alwayes arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at a
ſecure hauen, what wynd ſoeuer it had, when weak men, and ſuch as were
worldly wiſe, made account that it would haue periſhed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He that ſhall ponder with attention the frame, and forme
of the Inſtitute of this Religion, which God inſpired to this B. Father,
ſo like in the eſſentiall poynts to other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and ſo vnlike in
ſome, which are proper to it ſelfe. The progreſſe and propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion 
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:16367:173"/>which the hand of Almi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghty God hath giuen vnto it,
ſince that in ſixty yeares which are paſt (fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the yeare 1540. in which
the Pope con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it, vntil the yeare 1600. in which I write this hiſtory)
our Lord hath multiplyed, &amp; enlarged it throughout all the Kingdomes of
Chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dome, and in ſo many, &amp; ſo remote countryes of the Indians,
and barbarous people, where the light of the Ghoſpell had not before
appeared. So that in Angola, Monacongum, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomotapa, Braſil, Ethiopia,
Ormuz, Goa, Malaca, Malu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas, China, and Iaponia, and in the kingdomes of
Mogor, and Pegù, with others, our Fathers are reſident (to omit, 
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:16367:174"/>as more known, the firme la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Perù, new Spayne,
the Ilands of Manilla, or the Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines:) and the Society hath more then
three hundred, and fifty Colledges, and Houſes, diſtributed into three and
twenty Prouinces, and two vice-Prouinces.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He will alſo iudge the ſame, who ſhall caſt his
eyes vpon that which more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, to wit, the fruit which our Lord hath
drawne out of the labours of this B. Father, and of his children among
Catholiks, Infidells, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks. There is no cauſe to relate in this
place, that which belongeth to Catholiks, but only to conſider, &amp; ponder
it, ſince that we haue it before <pb n="329" facs="tcp:16367:174"/>our eyes, and we
ſee, &amp; touch with our hands the care, and ſollicitude, with which our
Fathers imploy themſelues in teaching children the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doctrine and
the youth good learning, and manners: in viſiting and comforting thoſe, who
are detayned in priſons, &amp; the ſick in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitalls, and in
releeuing the poore, and needy, &amp; helping men to dye well.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, that though the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth
hath fallen, and beene impayred much in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things: yet there hath been
great reformation in many ſeruants of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning preaching more
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably, and more oftner, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <pb n="330" facs="tcp:16367:175"/>prayer, and
meditation of the diuine Miſteryes: the vſe, and frequentation of the Holy
Sacraments of Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and Communion; and in mortification, &amp;
penna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: though al that is done be litle, if we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider, what we ought to
do. Likewiſe the other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Religion haue been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with many
ſcollers of the Society, who perſeuere, and floriſh in them with great
praiſe, and commendation. And theſe Religions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, encouraged
with the help and ſuccour, which our Fathers haue afforded them, haue more
diſcouered their holy zeale, and extended grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beames of their
ſanctity, and learning, ſuſtayning the <pb n="331" facs="tcp:16367:175"/>Common
wealth vpon their ſhoulders, &amp; mouing vs with their exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, to labour
more, and to attend with greater vigilancy, and carefulnes, to our
miniſteryes &amp; functions.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Infidells, is ſo much, that it
cannot be explicated in few words, neyther is it conuenient, that we ſhould
ſpend many, in declaring, what innumerable ſoules a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentills, the
chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this Bleſſed Father haue illuminated with light from heauen,
and brought to the knowledg of Ieſus Chriſt, and to the ſweet yoke of his

hath wrought by them, by reaſon that they were neceſſary for the
plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the faith in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Neyther can any, who inioy the peace
and quietnes, that thoſe who were borne in theſe Kingdomes do enioy

is that with the exemplar life of our Fathers, with the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like &amp;

and now is far greater) the holy Catholicke faith which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be decayed
and fallen in the Northern Prouinces, is reuiued, &amp; hath taken head, &amp;

thoſe which wauered, haue been confirmed in the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Church: and many Heretiks, who had forſaken it, haue returned to it agayn;
and thoſe who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue obſtinate, and blynd for theyr intereſt, and
ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, haue notwithſtanding loſt their former fury; and feare thoſe
of the Society (whome they call Ieſuites) and confeſſe playnly, that they
are their vtter enemyes, and as ſuch, they abhorre; calumniate, and
perſecute them.</p>
            <p n="8">8. There haue been many Colledges, &amp; Seminaryes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
for the education of <pb n="335" facs="tcp:16367:177"/>poore ſchollers, eſpecially of
thoſe, who are baniſhed, and ſuffer perſecution for theyr faith: and
there lyue in them many Prieſts, and Religious men of all orders, vnder the

returne to theyr Churches, and Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteryes, and are profitable for theyr
reformation, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke others by their examples. And by this meanes, and
by reaſon, that many from the Scholes of the Society haue entered into
Religion, the Clergy, and the Orders of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious themſelues (which in

            <p n="9">9. In like manner, whole Villages, Townes, Cittyes, and

their faith, and ſhewed by their actions, that they are children of the
Catholike Church. And that this fruit may be more dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and laſting, and
more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and pleaſing to our Lord: the ſonnes of Ignatius water
theſe plants with their bloud, dying for the Catholik faith, and teſtifying

            <p n="10">10. For becauſe the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks abhorre ſo much thoſe of

to perſecute, apprehend, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and vſe them like Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, as may be
ſeene daily, and experience it ſelfe hath made it manifeſt. The which
alſo is a great argument, that it is the worke of God, and that he 
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:16367:179"/>who founded it, was choſen by him, eſpecially with
his owne and his childrens la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, to amplify and enlarge the glory of the
ſame Lord who did chuſe him, and to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate his holy Catholike
Church.</p>
            <p n="11">11. And this is (as I haue ſaid) the greateſt, of all the
mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of this Bleſſed Father, and the Miracle of Miracles, in which are
contayned ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and ſo notable Miracles, as the wonderfull things are,
which our Lord hath wrought by him, and his children. Be he therfore
Bleſſed, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, as the Author, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of all that is good:
ſince that (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>Neither he who planteth, is
any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <pb n="339" facs="tcp:16367:179"/>nor he who watereth: but God who maketh that
to encreaſe and fructify, which is planted and watered:</hi> and to whom, as
to the roote thereof, all the beauty and fruit of the tree is due.</p>

            <p>VVE haue enlarged our ſelues much, in this life of our Bleſſed
Father Ignatius; but for that we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing knowne, and conuerſed ſo much with
him, it hath giuen vs leaue to exceed our <pb n="340" facs="tcp:16367:180"/>ordinary
courſe, &amp; indeed we know certainly that all which hath byn ſaid to be
too litle in reſpect of that which might be ſaid. And becauſe as yet he
is not a Canonized Saint, nor propoſed to the whole Church by the holy
Apoſtolick Sea to be inuocated, and reuerenced, as the others are, whoſe
lyues we haue written: it hath bin neceſſary to relate ſome more

               </gap>ngs, &amp; miracles,
which in the liues of other Saints might be for breuity well omitted. Though it
be certayne, that we pretermit many other, eſteeming theſe ſufficient for
that which we pretend in writing this life: that is, to glorify our Lord, who
hath made him a Saint, <pb n="341" facs="tcp:16367:180"/>to diſcouer his vertues, for our
example: and that they who are ignorant of them, may come to know them, and
conceiue deuotion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this holy Father.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And for this cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I make an end, I will add,
that as this Bleſſed Father was a Saynt in his life, ſo he was knowne,
eſteemed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenced for a Saynt by all thoſe, who treated with him,
and much more by them, who were more familiarly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him, becauſe
they did ſee more neerely his admirable vertues, and touched, as it were,
with their hand, the great gifts, and graces which God had endued him
withall.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Father Frauncis Xauier <pb n="342" facs="tcp:16367:181"/>an
Apoſtolicall man, and of ſuch rare ſanctity, by whom God wrought ſo
many, and great miracles, who illuſtrated innumerable Gentils, bare ſo
great deuotion, and reuerence to Father Ignatius, that he did carry a
ſubſcription of his in his boſome, as a firme buckler againſt all
dangers. And from the remote Countryes of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, he wrote letters vnto him,
vpon his knees.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Father Peter Faber, who was the firſt that ioyned with
him, in the erection of the Society, an admirable man, and of maruelous diuine
illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations; tooke Father Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius for his patterne, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of
Holynes, and of all vertue.</p>
            <pb n="343" facs="tcp:16367:181"/>
            <p n="5">5. Father Iames Laynes, the ſecond Generall of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
and a man ſo much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed in the world, for his great learning and
religion, told me, that becauſe God was ſo much pleaſed, with the ſoule
of his Seruant Ignatius, he did ſo much good to the Society, and ſo greatly
fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the children therof.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Father Frauncis Borgia, the third Generall of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
a man ſo well knowne to the world, by reaſon of his Nobility, and much more
of his Sanctity, went to Rome the yeare 1550. principally to ſee, know, and
conuerſe with Bleſſed Father Ignatius And when he ſaid his firſt
Maſſe, (which was in the <pb n="344" facs="tcp:16367:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>houſe of Loyola) he
kiſſed the floore of the Chamber where the Father was borne, by reaſon of
the great deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he bare vnto him, as vnto ſo holy a man. And this
was the opinion of all others who treated fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly with him. But not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thoſe who liued with him, had this eſtimation of his ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, but
likewiſe thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad had the ſame conceit and reſpect of him in like
manner.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Pope Paul the third, of bleſſed Memory, who was the
firſt that confirmed the Society, did very many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant things by the
coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle of this Bleſſed Father; and among others, one was 
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:16367:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>to inſtitute in Rome the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Counſell
of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and to appoynt foure moſt graue Cardinalls to haue
care of matters belonging to the Catholick faith, in that holy Tribunall.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Pope Iulius the third would not make Father Peter
Caniſius Biſhop of Vienna, as the King of the Romans Don Ferdinand
requeſted ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry earneſtly, becauſe B. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ignatius would not giue his
conſent therto: ſo great was the reſpect, which the Pope bare vnto
him.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Pope Marcellus the ſecond, who ſucceeded to Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius the
third, ſaid: That in matters of the Society, the authority of Father Ignatius
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:16367:183"/>alone was of more weight with him, then all the
rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which could be allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the contrary.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Pope Paul the fourth, (in the tyme of whoſe Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
the Bleſſed Father de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,) honoured him ſo much, that when he ſpake
with him, he bad him riſe vp, and couer his head.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Pope Gregory the 13. in the Bulls which be graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the
yeare of our Lord 1582. and 1583. in confirmation and defence, of the
Inſtitute of the Society, expreſly ſaith, That the holy Ghoſt
inſpired Ignatius to inſtitute the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to preſcribe the forme,
which the Iuſtitute thereof contayneth. He ſaith more, 
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:16367:183"/>That all the Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth is eaſed, and
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed by the children of the Society.</p>
            <p n="12">12. And he, and his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors Pius 1111. and Pius v.
do ſo exceedingly, and with ſuch exaggeration, praiſe and extoll the
miniſteryes, and functions of the Society, and the fruite which God hath
drawne, and daily dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth out of them, that for modeſty I will not relate
them in this place: but all this fruit proceeded (as from the roote thereof,)
from Ignatius, by the aſſiſtance of our Lords grace.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The King of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans (whom we named be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) Don
Ferdinando, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <pb n="348" facs="tcp:16367:184"/>the Colledges of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
which he founded, and his great fauour towards vs in reſpect of B. Father
Ignatius, being much inclyned to make Father Claudius Iayus (one of the firſt
Fathers) Biſhop of Trieſte, he did it not, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that Father
Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius was of a contrary opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and did not like it.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Don Iohn the third, King of Portugall, by reaſon of the
great deuotion which he bare to this Bleſſed Father, commaunded Father
Lewis Gonzales de Camera, when he went from Portugall to Rome, in the yeare
1553. to be attentiue, and conſider all the actions of Father Ignatius, and
write them in particuler <pb n="349" facs="tcp:16367:184"/>to him. Which the Father did,
and wrote to the King, that concerning the matter, which he had commended vnto
him, he was not ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed in the loue of God, by any ſpirituall
readinge, or prayer, as by the attention, which he vſed in behoulding Father
Ignatius.</p>
            <p n="15">15. The Cardinall Don Gaſpar de Quiroga, Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of
Toledo, and Generall Inquiſitor in the Kingdomes of Spayne, who in Rome had
byn the ſaid Fathers great friend, teſtifyeth of him, that he was a moſt
perfect man, truly humble, meeke, patient a deſpiſer of the world, and
inflamed with the zeale of Gods glory, and the good of <pb n="350" facs="tcp:16367:185"/>ſoules: and that he was neuer troubled, nor changed counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
for any variety of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, or aduerſity.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Cardinall Gabriel Paleotto, Biſhop of Bono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, calleth
him, The light of the Church: and ſaith, That God moued him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
the Society, for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtrengthening, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying, of
Eccleſiaſticall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipilne.</p>
            <p n="17">17. The Duke of Bauaria, Albertus, was very much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to
Bleſſed Father Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, and wrote vnto him many tymes, and reuerenced him
as a Saint, and for his reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect imbraced, and fauoured his children, as his
Succeſſors haue done euer ſince; who <pb n="351" facs="tcp:16367:185"/>haue inherited
no leſſe the Piety of theyr Aunceſtors, then the Greatnes of their

            <p n="18">18. The Preſident of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilla, Iohn Vega, being
Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour for the Emperour Charles the fifth, in Rome; held very great
friendſhip with the Father; and in a letter which he wrote to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
at the tyme of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, he called him <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> and
<hi>Holy Captaine,</hi> and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to haue his banner placed in Heauen, with

            <p n="19">19. Maiſter Iohn of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uila, an Apoſtolicall Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,

we ſhall find, that the greateſt, and moſt mighty Princes of
Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, haue deſired, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeched it with great inſtance. For
